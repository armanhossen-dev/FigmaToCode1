# MERN Stack Course Task 01 of  *"Figma Design to Code"*

This repository showcases the conversion of a modern Figma web design into a fully functional frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was completed as part of our MERN Stack learning journey to enhance our UI development skills and understanding of design-to-code workflows.

## 🚀 Project Overview

- ✨ **Goal**: Recreate a given Figma design using clean, responsive HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
- 💡 **Focus**: UI structure, design accuracy, and component-based thinking.
- 📚 **Part of**: MERN Stack Learning Course

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (vanilla)  
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) (for design reference)

> _Note: This repository only covers the frontend (UI) part of the MERN stack. Backend (Node.js, Express, MongoDB) will be implemented in future tasks._
